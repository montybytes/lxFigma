# Figma Linux

ðŸš§ **In Development**

## Description

This is my take on an electron.js wrapper for Figma.com I developed for linux.

By default (thanks to the web app already doing it) the electron app supports:

- caching logins
- desktop notifications maybe ?? (need to test)

### TO-DO

- [ ] Only allow single instance to run at a time
- [ ] Add tabs in order to feel like the official app on windows/mac
- [ ] Add UI zooming keyboard shortcuts
